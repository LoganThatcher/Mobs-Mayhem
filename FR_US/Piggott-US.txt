1. As a beginner, I want to only use the arrow keys for player movement, so the game can be simple to play.
2. As a competitive player, I want the game to keep track of a score, so I can keep track of how well I am doing this round.
3. As a player, I want the game to have a story, so it is more interesting to play.
